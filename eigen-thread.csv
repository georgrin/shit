luz33c	The test net deligator shouldn't get it because it's a test net ah, your project is containing three roles avs, operator, and deligator, and you're now equivalent to giving a deligator bonus only. Of course you are happy to get the rewards, but you have overlooked the fact that it is very difficult for this project to compete with similar projects, and it has forgotten what kind of project it is!	2024-05-12T06:31:43.749000+00:00
shaonian	I must say that I feel that the team has rewarded the addresses that contribute to the testnet according to their screening method, but my node serves as both an operator and a restaker, and the team seems to have ignored my 400 reward as an operator. This may be because my address already received some compensation for being a restaker, but I was short of the operator's 400 reward. I don't think there is any other problem.	2024-05-12T05:00:49.868000+00:00

cheetah33333	"While it's understandable to be disappointed, it's important to remember that airdrops are rarely about equal distribution; they're strategic tools used to incentivize specific behaviors and contributions. The initial announcement of a non-incentivized testnet further underscores that there were no guarantees of rewards.

Instead of fixating on the outcome of this particular airdrop, shift your focus to the invaluable knowledge and experience you gained through your participation. The skills you acquired and the insights you gleaned are the true rewards that will continue to benefit you in the long run and better prepare you for future opportunities ."	2024-05-11T20:06:46.660000+00:00
wale217	Sadly, a few  insensitive ones who got some allocation because they spent more, thinks others who also made some effort but spent less don’t have a right to receive anything.	2024-05-11T19:48:09.381000+00:00
_smeee	Nope	2024-05-11T19:44:33.394000+00:00
j13aowcxsvw3549	wow, getting lido steth in goerli was real pain in the ass, spent a lot of time to get it and have no reward...	2024-05-11T19:31:15.438000+00:00
bkz	hyuk is right	2024-05-11T18:15:42.930000+00:00
cheetah33333	if you want incentives then opt into EigenDA on mainnet if you don't do that you are just wasting time.	2024-05-11T18:13:43.045000+00:00
wale217	At the very least, every testnet participant deserves something, no matter how little.	2024-05-11T18:12:44.420000+00:00
wale217	On a freaking VPS man. Don’t be insensitive. Stop downplaying other people’s efforts	2024-05-11T18:07:04.299000+00:00
wale217	<@127915375248670720> <@651018891434131456> you were both well rewarded so you don’t care about what happens to anyone else. That shouldn’t be how life goes. It wouldn’t take anything from you to at least fight for others who couldn’t get anything at all.	2024-05-11T18:04:20.827000+00:00
luz33c	If you want to reward users, you should clearly define the rules and give them rewards according to their participation level, or no rewards (since the test network has no incentives), rather than rewarding those who spend more money on test coins. Eigenda should be treated fairly, operators should be treated fairly, and those who participated early should be treated fairly. You should not only encourage test networks to spend money on test coins. This is not a rule.	2024-05-11T18:03:21.261000+00:00
sifu0620	thanks for your help!	2024-05-11T18:02:10.151000+00:00

hyuk	thanks eigenlayer team	2024-05-11T17:57:40.464000+00:00
cheetah33333	yeah ths is what u are supposed to do its practicing good security	2024-05-11T17:57:35.028000+00:00

wale217	I see. This explains your lukewarm outlook to the whole situation. You were obviously well rewarded	2024-05-11T17:57:17.039000+00:00
hyuk	how	2024-05-11T17:56:22.769000+00:00
sifu0620	adresse?	2024-05-11T17:56:14.064000+00:00
cheetah33333	that's great!	2024-05-11T17:55:58.890000+00:00
hyuk	i received 1500	2024-05-11T17:55:46.008000+00:00
maciver_	can confirm	2024-05-11T17:55:41.773000+00:00
maciver_	this is what happened	2024-05-11T17:55:37.421000+00:00
cheetah33333	that makes sense to me because these addresses likely spent money to buy the gETH and were prob the operator themselves delegating from a restaker address that is what you are supposed to do...  therefore this person contributed more than someone who got free .1 worth of gETH and did nothing else	2024-05-11T17:55:27.405000+00:00
sifu0620	no noise, just trying to understand	2024-05-11T17:55:17.252000+00:00
_smeee	this just is not true	2024-05-11T17:55:01.725000+00:00
hyuk	lmao	2024-05-11T17:54:46.551000+00:00
hyuk	yeah cuz they arent top 200	2024-05-11T17:54:44.962000+00:00
sifu0620	some in top 200 did not received as you can read above	2024-05-11T17:54:33.421000+00:00
cheetah33333	You cannot make statements like this and not back it up. otherwise you are just making noise.	2024-05-11T17:54:29.511000+00:00
hyuk	top 200 received 500 tokens, ppl that delegated an absurd amount in geth recevied 1k+	2024-05-11T17:54:27.954000+00:00
sifu0620	exactly totally random	2024-05-11T17:54:09.933000+00:00
hyuk	nobody else	2024-05-11T17:54:09.793000+00:00
wale217	Scroll up and read	2024-05-11T17:54:08.047000+00:00
hyuk	everyone in the top 200 received rewards	2024-05-11T17:54:07.142000+00:00
wale217	My point exactly, it was all so random and absurd	2024-05-11T17:53:58.158000+00:00
sifu0620	nope :S	2024-05-11T17:53:53.176000+00:00
sifu0620	i will not send the adress in public	2024-05-11T17:53:46.042000+00:00
cheetah33333	Because they ran validation services for EigenDA and got plenty of delegations to stay in the top 200	2024-05-11T17:53:44.883000+00:00
hyuk	like who	2024-05-11T17:53:22.289000+00:00
sifu0620	some get rewards and deposit 0	2024-05-11T17:53:17.938000+00:00
cheetah33333	You deposited .1 goerli ETH	2024-05-11T17:52:58.753000+00:00
sifu0620	some gets rewards and there were never in the top 200	2024-05-11T17:52:50.381000+00:00
cheetah33333	You werent in the top 200 ever	2024-05-11T17:52:20.501000+00:00
sifu0620	but this is not the point, some adresse been rewards without anything as there were garbage and failed delegator adrress	2024-05-11T17:51:58.914000+00:00
sifu0620	i sent it lately, search my name	2024-05-11T17:51:13.997000+00:00
cheetah33333	send your address	2024-05-11T17:50:29.624000+00:00
sifu0620	they did not	2024-05-11T17:49:49.593000+00:00
cheetah33333	lol you could if you were technical enough its on chain buddy	2024-05-11T17:47:41.208000+00:00
_smeee	I don't care how you take me. I came here looking for the merkle data of the contract. Turns out they are not making it public so we cannot claim from the contract. Project just gets worse and worse.	2024-05-11T17:47:00.861000+00:00
cheetah33333	no, there were just missed addresses in the preview... that is the point of doing a preview so you can catch mistakes	2024-05-11T17:46:35.168000+00:00
wale217	They initially started with allocations of minimal EIGEN token allocations as airdrop until there was a backlash that made them actually see things for what they are. What they’re doing to the testnet participants isn’t right and I won’t just sit idly by and stay silent. I’m 100% certain I’m a lot more productive than you are. A closed mouth is a closed destiny, we all have a right to voice our grievances	2024-05-11T17:45:41.919000+00:00
cheetah33333	they did. send your address or you are not going to be taken seriously	2024-05-11T17:44:50.734000+00:00
_systemus	I agree. People who are not responsible for their words are no longer worthy of a drop of our attention and no one will return the contribution to the development of this unfair distribution. Karma itself will overtake those who made the decision and their descendants. Amen.	2024-05-11T17:43:21.293000+00:00
luz33c	Eigenlayer needs capitalists, as well as avs and operators that can actually run and maintain blockchain node services. The three are interdependent. Your point of view is not reasonable. It does not consider the development of the eigenlayer project. We are not worried about not getting it. We are really worried about eigenlayer. (If it is because of such a wrong decision)	2024-05-11T17:39:17.530000+00:00
wale217	Keep quiet. You have nothing meaningful to add to this conversation.  I have a right to speak against perceived injustice	2024-05-11T17:36:55.390000+00:00
_systemus	I tested their testnet steak restake. They were officially branded by the NFT. I believed them when they said that I would get a steak in other protocols after the snapshot from March 15 to April 29 - but it was a lie. Result: I am not worthy of the award ( - perhaps this team has not gone far from Starknet.	2024-05-11T17:35:00.897000+00:00
_smeee	they did not	2024-05-11T17:34:52.511000+00:00
cheetah33333	they clearly rewarded people that were in the top 200 I did not make the rules.	2024-05-11T17:33:56.227000+00:00
maciver_	"Stop complaining. You missed out. Move on. 

No one asked you to be an operator. They compensated those who actually ran EigenDA and made a meaningful contribution to testnet. You spent 5mins setting up an operator address, stop trying to get a free lunch."	2024-05-11T17:33:53.163000+00:00
wale217	But I did everything else I could do, so you have no right to tell I don’t deserve a reward	2024-05-11T17:32:01.564000+00:00
wale217	As much as I wanted to do more. I couldn’t because of the requirements of an enormous amount of goerli eth	2024-05-11T17:31:20.751000+00:00
wale217	I was labeled an operator, you’re not the one to determine who was and wasn’t an operator	2024-05-11T17:30:35.917000+00:00
wale217	We were unfairly treated and we have a right to voice our complaints	2024-05-11T17:29:59.157000+00:00
cheetah33333	I am being technical in that you are not an operator if you did not run validation services for EigenDA that is literally what makes an operator an operator. There is no bias here its just facts.	2024-05-11T17:29:30.156000+00:00
cheetah33333	there was no obligation to give anyone anything	2024-05-11T17:28:25.599000+00:00
wale217	You’re not being real, you’re being bias and very negative.  Airdrops are incentives for activities that community members partake in.  Just because you don’t fall in our category does not mean you get the right to downplay our efforts	2024-05-11T17:28:24.713000+00:00
cheetah33333	how did they do them dirty? they said it was not incentivized literally from day one....then they gave a little bit to ppl that actually had meaningful contributions on the testnet which was really nice of them to do.	2024-05-11T17:28:08.754000+00:00
_smeee	You can try to spin it all you want, but they did testnet operators dirty. Personally, I would likely be running eigenda on mainnet right now if they had not done this. After this, I won't ever touch this project again except to dump my airdrop from mainnet.	2024-05-11T17:25:22.367000+00:00
luz33c	No, I'm not frustrated! On the contrary, I'm frustrated for eigen. All the feedback is because we like this project. Great projects should make wise decisions instead of creating unreasonable ones. Our feedback is to hope that the project will be better.	2024-05-11T17:24:01.872000+00:00
cheetah33333	You don't have to run the testnet if you don't want to... why are you not running mainnet? I get that you are upset but they never promised you anything, they actually did the opposite.	2024-05-11T17:14:57.632000+00:00
cheetah33333	You weren't an actual operator though... to be an operator you needed to run EigenDA and you did not so you did not qualify... I would focus your efforts on staking on the mainnet if you are looking to make returns on your time and capital. I am not trying to be negative I am just being real.	2024-05-11T17:13:02.271000+00:00
luz33c	Why did HoleSky start? I did see that HoleSky has no incentives. But Goerli also said in 2023 that it is a non-incentivized test network, only for testing. I don't think I am not qualified, because both test networks are prepared for the main network, and HoleSky is the continuation of GoerLi. During the HoleSky stage, several versions were upgraded and functions were added. My question is that users who paid for rankings received rewards even though they knew that GoerLi was about to be abandoned. Users who have been following Eigenlayer upgrades have been ignored.	2024-05-11T17:12:55.548000+00:00
wale217	You have absolutely no point and no right to downplay anyone’s efforts	2024-05-11T17:03:12.484000+00:00
wale217	Every contribution counts	2024-05-11T17:02:29.158000+00:00
wale217	"Those operations required a lot of goerli eth, regardless , my effort definitely deserves to be rewarded. I engaged with the testnet but couldn’t meet up with the requirements to be in the top 200 avs.
This is not how to treat community members. Why should Sybils and meager eth restakers deserve a reward and not testnet operators??"	2024-05-11T17:01:27.035000+00:00
cheetah33333	You never ran the actual operations and deposited like 5 free goerli ETH. What's your point? Time to pack it up and focus on more productive things.	2024-05-11T16:56:26.469000+00:00
cheetah33333	Since you've confirmed that you didn't qualify for the Goerli testnet concession, I suggest focusing on something else since its obvious you did not qualify and they said so many times they are not giving any more incentives for testnets. This will help everyone use their time more effectively, including yours.	2024-05-11T16:53:51.760000+00:00

hyuk	theres no reason to reward holesky cuz mainnet launched shortly after goerli depreciated lol	2024-05-11T16:50:58.095000+00:00
luz33c	But I have been maintaining Eigenda for more than a month. I have been following the two test networks. The official said that the test network is used for testing and has no incentives (including Goerli and Holesky. They should be treated equally and should not be based on the so-called inconvenience on the test network (everyone knows that Goerli will be closed in March). The test network should be for technical personnel to participate in decentralized node testing, not like the main network where real gold is used for gambling.	2024-05-11T16:48:57.309000+00:00
cheetah33333	This address never ran EigenDA on Goerli.	2024-05-11T16:31:27.685000+00:00
hyuk	Everyone that was in the top 200 received 500 afaik, then they gave some to ppl that delegated with a huge amount of geth	2024-05-11T16:21:53.356000+00:00
luz33c	I keep an eye on the update status of the test network and go ahead and update my nodes in a timely manner. Even now my node is still running, I'm well aware that it's not a continuous thread, as there are upgrades that rejoin eigenda	2024-05-11T16:16:31.325000+00:00
luz33c	0xA90cee5b1e80A31a0b9B1BE5A1Bb66B0EE2dBc00 my operator address ～   Goerli and holesky are both operators, and I actually run the EigenDa node.  I have submitted Tickets, no one has bothered me, and I have had to deal with communication from scammers posing as officials.	2024-05-11T16:15:57.017000+00:00
cheetah33333	Hey, can you drop your operator address and some real talk about what you've actually done on the testnet? Let's see the feedback you've given, how much gETH you staked, the delegations you hustled, and how you did with EigenDA signing. If you can't show us the goods, then you're just making noise. Time to back up those complaints with some proof or pack it in!	2024-05-11T16:05:51.275000+00:00
luz33c	"I hope the team changes the testnet reward strategy so that users are treated fairly. We participated in the whole upgrade of TestNet because we are also optimistic about the program and have some skills.

I don't have a problem if none of them are rewarded, but some should not be and some should not. This goes against the statement that there are no incentives on TestNet."	2024-05-11T16:00:36.912000+00:00
bkz	It’s the wallets I used to stake on my top 200 node	2024-05-11T15:43:40.909000+00:00
wale217	It’s weird how some wallets were rewarded and others weren’t	2024-05-11T15:42:57.842000+00:00
bkz	I got more on the restaker addresses	2024-05-11T15:39:20.021000+00:00
cheetah33333	You don't know what the price of EIGEN will be.... plus did you check your restaker addresses too? ... Perpetual markets often undervalue projects like EIGEN, which is considered top-tier. Holding your assets might be wise even after the unlock; just wait and see. It's fortunate you have any return at all, considering the testnets were explicitly not incentivized. Investing in them was a risk, as there was no promise of a reward—they were intended solely for gearing up for mainnet operations.	2024-05-11T15:36:16.707000+00:00

cheetah33333	Goerli (and now Holesky) was an explicitly non incentivized testnet to begin with you can see that in the original blog post: https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/stage-1-testnet-announcement/	2024-05-11T15:10:30.477000+00:00
m0zgiii.ton	It will be a very ugly act on the part of the project developers if they do not reward the people who spent their resources installing operators in their project. Goerli and Holesky operators should be rewarded, as well as the rest of the people who interacted with the project during the period of the snapshots.	2024-05-11T14:47:58.012000+00:00
coinosophy	Shutting access to the testnet site was a bad move and whoever made the decision should be removed.	2024-05-11T13:54:34.308000+00:00
coinosophy	I hope their runway budget includes the expenses they will incur if a new solution is not brought forth.	2024-05-11T13:53:31.020000+00:00
coinosophy	They need to fix this or they are going to have issues. You can’t just deprecate your testnet site and make all assets inaccessible and then give someone a small portion of deposited funds….	2024-05-11T13:52:39.944000+00:00

coinosophy	Very upset	2024-05-11T13:50:07.417000+00:00
coinosophy	I delegated gETH and my validator bounced between #1 and #3  in TVL and my operator got 400 + 100	2024-05-11T13:50:02.076000+00:00
wale217	A bunch of people just bought and staked a few eth on ether fi or puffer and got 110 tokens. But community that participated in testnet and ran a node got nothing. That can’t be right.	2024-05-11T13:14:55.089000+00:00
wale217	This is all just so disappointing, I hope the EIGEN team can look into this and reward their testnet node operators accordingly	2024-05-11T13:12:30.882000+00:00
wale217	I delegated ETH with mine and got nothing. There’s no pattern or criteria that was followed. Everything was just random and very unfair	2024-05-11T13:10:30.034000+00:00
defi_chopper	damn i got burned lol, i delegated ETH with my operator but i only got 500	2024-05-11T11:57:53.743000+00:00

hyuk	check the addresses that delegated huge amounts of eth	2024-05-11T11:42:14.509000+00:00
hyuk	not bad	2024-05-11T11:37:22.462000+00:00
hyuk	i got 1500 in total	2024-05-11T11:37:21.957000+00:00
defi_chopper	an operator that delegated to itself also only got 500, idk how it works	2024-05-11T11:36:50.393000+00:00
hyuk	operator gets 500, ppl that delegated get even more depending on eth amount	2024-05-11T11:21:36.386000+00:00
hyuk	oh now it makes sense	2024-05-11T11:21:15.751000+00:00
hyuk	wait how did some ppl get 1200 for their node without staking any assets and some operators got 500 lol	2024-05-11T11:18:57.069000+00:00
maciver_	<@875066441714520064> <@466815633347313664> - Just finished the claiming process. Thanks for everything the past few weeks, i know its been a hassle dealing with everything and answering the same question 1000 times. Pass on the appreciation to the team aswell. The vast majority of people who participated in testnet have seen there contributions rewarded - and will continue to participate in the eigenlayer ecosystem. Cheers.	2024-05-11T10:54:00.026000+00:00

effenberggesture	"I agree that's unfair, but for another reason. Those, who joined in January, made more significant contribution than those, who joined in February. And those, who entered in November, should outplay them both.

anotyagi	You says it's not random then what is this , user get allocation without doing nothing 😟😟	2024-05-11T06:32:17.398000+00:00
defi_chopper	"And for operators that were a staker/delegator with a large amount of stakes, the allocation for the operator was not respected as other wallets  that were purely stakers

This tells me the devs might've made a mistake in the code to handle the edge case where an address is an operator and a delegator, and the devs have hardcoded the max allocation to 500"	2024-05-11T06:23:44.497000+00:00
defi_chopper	"I would like to know how team finalized the number of max 500 EIGEN tokens for top 200 operators

For operators that were not a staker/delegator, the total server costs is ~$5k per the requirements + the hours of time spent to maintain the operator to keep it up-to-date

Now a testnet staker who stakes $10 across 5 walelts and do nothing else is getting the same allocation as a top 200 AVS operator?"	2024-05-11T06:18:58.244000+00:00
effenberggesture	"I can make a guess about how it works.

There are more than 280k stakers accordignly to the last week's update. That's enough to create a negative atmosphere around the project, which they proved in Twitter straight after the initial TGE announcement. This is why they deserve a solid addition of ~1.66% to their 15% allocation.

Meanwhile, accordingly to the data from this thread, there are just 453 validators, who signed at least 1 batch in the active set. They (or should I say we?) can't even reach an agreement here, so it's unlikely they will manage to capture community's attention with their complaints in media. This is why they deserve just ~0.013533322% allocation  (453 * 500 / 1 673 646 668 if all the mentioned data is correct). The allocation per operator doesn't even cover what we got rekt for as a result of Goerli shutdown.

All this story is a great example of how negative stimulus are created in crypto. If you have some tech skills and try to make a long term contribution into a project you like you don't even deserve your expenses to be covered. But if you simply split your ETH stake into many wallets and forget about the project until the airdrop announcement, you may get a pretty solid allocation just for spending some time on dispersing your funds.

Someone should tell about it to Mr. Bryan Pellegrino. It perfectly explains why people become sybils instead of trying to develop skills for more advanced kinds of contribution"	2024-05-11T06:07:33.534000+00:00

luz33c	Since it was developed for them to help test, I think Eigen hopes that Eigenda will conduct decentralized testing, otherwise the official can run Eigenda itself. You give some rewards to my supporters, and the supporters continue to run the operator. This is a positive cycle. It is incorrect to give rewards to users who have suffered heavy losses based on the closure of the test network.	2024-05-11T04:00:00.830000+00:00

.xkamx	This is really poor on the team's part. To act like our concerns (all entirely valid by the way) were being addressed, and this was an innocent oversight, just to pacify us is unbelievable...While 500 is better than nothing, it doesn't come close to making most of us whole, which is absurd based on the % of tokens available for community/ecosystem; not to mention the ridiculous # of team/investor tokens. Had they any regard for their reputation or this community (operators specifically, who helped them get to this stage with a pretty substantial amount of time, effort, and money) I'd have thought they would overcorrect as a show of good faith, but clearly greed won out. Whether that's because of scummy advisors in their ear, or they arrived at this conclusion on their own, it's just really lame and disappointing.	2024-05-10T23:37:00.709000+00:00

money658	Then what is the criteria if it is not random...???	2024-05-10T21:44:41.463000+00:00
web3cm	Not everyone got a reward. Only certain testnet users. If you don't see an allocation, then it means you are not eligible	2024-05-10T21:38:26.801000+00:00
money658	What is the criteria	2024-05-10T21:26:27.044000+00:00

juans1719	"mm so there was some sort of filtering across testnet operator right?

Would like to see the requirements taken into account becaause I did spent time & money on trying it out. 

And besides I guess there is nothing to do regarding receiving EIGEN after all, I at least feel we deserve the reasoning or explanation of why certain operators dont receive allocation"	2024-05-10T20:56:09.479000+00:00
web3cm	Team already reviewed everything onchain	2024-05-10T20:53:36.276000+00:00

bholu.eth	and people arent even asking for an airdrop rly... we all know you guys are too full of it to even consider that. the ask here was always to be made whole for gEth lost due to you all's lack of comms	2024-05-10T20:52:12.520000+00:00
bholu.eth	saying testnet was not incentivized so people shouldnt have done it is classic "take everything and give nothing back" mindset - mainnet wouldnt have launched w/o identifying issues in testnet, w/o these operators	2024-05-10T20:50:56.277000+00:00
money658	This is bad for the ecosystem	2024-05-10T20:50:28.464000+00:00

ren3363	More likely the reasons for not publishing the criteria are so embarrassing that the team needs to hide behind "security reasons". Very weak and disappointing to hear such an excuse from a team with such a promising vision.	2024-05-10T20:46:05.753000+00:00

ivanhuk.	"First of all you should make sure that you was in top 200. I belive team will not reward for just creating the operator. And it is expected.
As i see on the address above there is only 1gETH. It defenetly impossible you operator to be in top200 with such small amount"	2024-05-10T20:27:48.418000+00:00

anotyagi	It's to fair sir , I can stake my fund in eigen rather then invested in node run then it's worth it and more profitable for me.	2024-05-10T20:13:24.944000+00:00
money658	Same here bro	2024-05-10T20:13:05.152000+00:00

web3cm	I don't think it was stated that it was "random"	2024-05-10T20:11:09.147000+00:00
anotyagi	But why doing random selection, I'm doing approx 4 eth investment for my operator node and at the you guys doing random selection for operators.	2024-05-10T20:10:34.065000+00:00
web3cm	Then it means you are not eligible. Only certain users got allocations	2024-05-10T20:08:27.576000+00:00

kopath4	Why was there a need to mislead?	2024-05-10T19:18:27.440000+00:00

rhymlore	Wait when did they collect addresses?	2024-05-10T18:53:17.925000+00:00
kopath4	I spent more than 2 ETH to participate in the test network and compete for a place among the first 200 AVS. Why bother collecting addresses only to end up giving nothing? It's a clown show.	2024-05-10T18:52:52.446000+00:00
rhymlore	Man I delegated bunch of ETH to my Goerli Operator, didn't run it for too long though, is that why I'm not eligible?	2024-05-10T18:52:37.705000+00:00

maciver_	need someone to confirm tho, I can’t check atm. Just passing on info from others who have claimed in another discord	2024-05-10T18:43:34.475000+00:00
chibronsec	Holesky or Goerli ?	2024-05-10T18:43:01.771000+00:00
maciver_	This all for goerli testnet	2024-05-10T18:43:01.679000+00:00
maciver_	Top 200 AVS also got the same allocation of 500 eigen tokens	2024-05-10T18:42:50.789000+00:00
maciver_	So it seems that every operator address got 500 eigen tokens?	2024-05-10T18:42:27.400000+00:00

romank6511	I'm happy with my reward. Thanks Eigen Team!!!!	2024-05-10T17:45:55.447000+00:00
.skond	if I wasn't in top 200? I am not eligible this time again	2024-05-10T17:43:09.189000+00:00
.skond	so only who was in top 200 are eligible for eigen?	2024-05-10T17:42:55.100000+00:00
dreamgallery	Let him check his 2 delegated wallets	2024-05-10T17:38:17.927000+00:00
sweetsensi	the rest was from the others	2024-05-10T17:36:26.824000+00:00
sweetsensi	he asked others to delegate to him, because had external campaign, so only 2 delegated wallets belonged to him	2024-05-10T17:35:55.683000+00:00
dreamgallery	So how much did he delegate himself?	2024-05-10T17:35:03.866000+00:00
sweetsensi	he was in top20 (not 200)	2024-05-10T17:34:23.228000+00:00
mojtaba93	me too. was in 200 avs untill the network shutdown	2024-05-10T17:33:06.546000+00:00
dreamgallery	"I think the 500 is for the operator address(I guess that need to keep in top 200 for a period and sign before)
And your friend can check his delegator address, the reward is likely to depend on the amount you staked at the time"	2024-05-10T17:33:03.420000+00:00
sweetsensi	my friend got only 500 tokens (included 100 as a bonus for everyone), it's hilarous how the team treats builders, I'm curious how much the rest of us will get	2024-05-10T17:30:40.351000+00:00
web3cm	Please wait for the update on season 2. Missed is because some testnet users got them, but some others are missing. Wait for the details in June	2024-05-10T17:24:10.954000+00:00
sweetsensi	based on your note some operators from top200 got tokens? if yes then how much was the allocation or at least tell us why some got it?	2024-05-10T17:22:30.356000+00:00
sweetsensi	what do you mean by missed?	2024-05-10T17:21:08.390000+00:00
moshiri	mind if i ask how much your operator received?	2024-05-10T17:21:02.734000+00:00
web3cm	As per the first update, missed testnet user allocations will be updated as part of Phase 2 of Season 1.	2024-05-10T17:20:52.213000+00:00
arturionx	"Any news? <@875066441714520064> 
Still waiting for announcement? 
Claim has already started and we are still waiting..."	2024-05-10T17:15:33.394000+00:00
mojtaba93	how much?	2024-05-10T17:15:09.023000+00:00
.xkamx	and your operator address was nothing more than that? like you didn't delegate from that address as well?	2024-05-10T17:13:23.393000+00:00
.xkamx	I wouldn't even go this far...should be based off of time-weighted avg of time spent in the top 200, or based on # of batches signed or something. although giving everyone who was top 200 at some point probably not a bad idea, but it should be weighted imo	2024-05-10T17:12:12.034000+00:00
anotyagi	Totally agree with you I'm also saying rewarding only active sets but not only AVS	2024-05-10T14:43:54.630000+00:00
effenberggesture	"It's wrong because only operators of the active set participate in the validation process.

Meanwhile, the only thing required for a simple registration of an operator is installing EigenLayer CLI. It can be done locally without even opting-in to EigenDA and running a node.

I agree with <@1102299860356567100> and his opinion above: creating an operator and then doing nothing looks like a sybil activity"	2024-05-10T14:42:48.466000+00:00
anotyagi	He not providing rewards only for whales 😉	2024-05-10T13:54:43.431000+00:00
anotyagi	"Let's wait for announcement, because I know eigen team doing fair rewards for their early users and early testnet users also . 

As you see eigen team distribution rewards for every stakers . Minimum 100 eigen for every stakers."	2024-05-10T13:53:52.471000+00:00
anotyagi	Ohh, I don't no you are part of eigen team my bad 😂😂	2024-05-10T13:51:15.882000+00:00
.mormoon	If you can't meet the standard Top200 requirements, you're not eligible. It's that simple.	2024-05-10T13:29:21.333000+00:00
anotyagi	how can you say that only top 200 AVS operators deserve rewards because all guys doing same things as you doing, only difference between amount of goreli eth.	2024-05-10T13:23:43.509000+00:00
dopaminechaos	Claim is here, anything announced for Goreli/holsky operators?	2024-05-10T12:38:11.110000+00:00
.mormoon	"A lot of people here are muddying the waters!
Again, only the Top200 AVS operotors deserve rewards!"	2024-05-10T11:56:46.558000+00:00

Rewards are reserved solely for the Top200 AVS operators!

amit3538	Everyone is greedy and selfish for some extent noone is here to do charity work everyone wants something in return for what they did	2024-05-10T06:52:27.585000+00:00
sifu0620	hum sybils is an other thing, may we not put them is same basket	2024-05-09T14:28:13.596000+00:00
ivanhuk.	If you are not doing job you should not be rewarded. It simple. Only people who was in top200 for some perion should be rewarded. I do not agree that team should reward sybils who just created operetors and did nothing.	2024-05-09T13:46:40.682000+00:00
sifu0620	not crazy a lot of them just want to get a drop based on their criteria without thinking about others : greedy is the term	2024-05-09T08:40:05.999000+00:00
sifu0620	nope i didnt enter the race to buy large amount of testnet token, this was stupid	2024-05-09T08:39:15.338000+00:00
defi_chopper	calling people who just want to be made whole greedy its crazy	2024-05-09T05:27:25.231000+00:00

sifu0620	Greedy and selfish yes, they only want them to be eligible for something, nobody ask to inject real money and now they play like the team own them something	2024-05-08T18:26:29.263000+00:00
sweetsensi	greedy? people spent their time and money and without them eigenlayer couldn't exist today like this	2024-05-08T17:48:34.053000+00:00
sifu0620	Too many greedy folks its crazy	2024-05-08T17:31:53.217000+00:00
web3cm	Just stay tuned for the next announcement. It says testnet users in general for now	2024-05-06T20:34:57.493000+00:00
kmi99	Cuase i dont ask about an other testnet users like delegators	2024-05-06T20:28:55.470000+00:00
kmi99	About AVS reward? Right?	2024-05-06T20:28:05.453000+00:00
web3cm	It will be announced in the coming weeks	2024-05-06T20:27:13.402000+00:00
kmi99	I mean, it will be announced this week according to the announcement.	2024-05-06T20:26:16.517000+00:00
web3cm	What do you mean?	2024-05-06T19:04:57.235000+00:00
kmi99	3.	2024-05-06T18:55:19.828000+00:00
kmi99	According to the announcement of the Foundation this week, it should be determined.	2024-05-06T18:55:01.089000+00:00
web3cm	Stay tuned, no ETA yet	2024-05-06T17:26:07.392000+00:00
kmi99	<@875066441714520064> wen announ about AVS REWARD?	2024-05-06T17:23:41.921000+00:00
sifu0620	Nope as the game was only artificial with the pumping price, test net isnt only validating	2024-05-06T15:38:10.673000+00:00
maciver_	"If you weren't in the top 200, you didn't contribute and shouldn't be expecting anything. Any airdrop should be based of signing quantity and %. 

Team aren't dumb, they will organize fairly."	2024-05-06T14:08:01.596000+00:00
sifu0620	all nodes operator must be granted, nobody asked for injecting money and inflate the goerlieth price, it was just a risky play for which did it	2024-05-06T09:55:58.180000+00:00
luz33c	I think actual contribution should be considered, not some cash loss, just running testnet nodes and going on a gamble to buy test coins shouldn't be a reason to give rewards. I think any testnet eigenda in 2023 2024 should be rewarded (i.e. top200, and nodes that run a real eigenda testnet).	2024-05-06T08:21:18.941000+00:00
effenberggesture	"That's a good point. Celestia is the latest tier-1 project with long-term nodes-related testnet. I've just checked and found they allocated 1.4% of the total supply to testnet validators.

I admit EigenLayer is built differently and Celestia didn't have any stakers before the TGE. However so big gap in allocation **in compare** with both Stakedrop and how other tier-1 projects valuated testnet validators contribution is discouraging"	2024-05-06T00:31:28.275000+00:00
lyde17tc	exact	2024-05-05T21:53:44.186000+00:00
kmi99	Exactly	2024-05-05T21:25:32.974000+00:00
romantereh	Actually 8-10K $TIA tokens it was for LightNode. Validators get around 50-100K $TIA	2024-05-05T21:21:20.985000+00:00
kmi99	"Celestia's reward value was reached 200,000$ at the top. 
They sent 10,000 tokens to node operators. And Tia's price was reached 20$"	2024-05-05T21:10:30.804000+00:00
ivanhuk.	Yes. Especially if we would compare with Celestia)	2024-05-05T21:01:45.875000+00:00
kmi99	"3000 tokens for 500 AVS operators = 1,500,000 tokens =Less than  0.1% of total supply.
Its almost nothing for eigen layer"	2024-05-05T21:00:44.832000+00:00
ivanhuk.	I don't mind 🙂	2024-05-05T20:58:50.614000+00:00
kmi99	If they are want to  distributing tokens to AVS operators, they should distribute at least 3000 tokens	2024-05-05T20:57:20.331000+00:00
ivanhuk.	I was be able to buy most goerli for 0.1 and part for 0.25. But I agree with you if you buy most for 0.25 it will even do not compensate for you.	2024-05-05T20:57:18.485000+00:00
kmi99	1200 tokens? It doesn't even compensate for the loss of goerli network shutdown	2024-05-05T20:54:26.351000+00:00
ivanhuk.	"In most testnets where only active set metter the project is rewarding only active operators/validators. As for me the right solution should be to reward operators who was in active set according to it uptime. Other 4K operators who just setup node and did not contribute should only be eligable for some miniml drop.
As I see the people discussint the amount of 1200 tokens. But for operators who was running the node till goerli deprecation this is just a compensation of money spend for goerli.
Yes the Goerli was a test coin but this test coin had real price on the testnetbridge and the price was around 0.25$. Peoples lost their money because continue running operators."	2024-05-05T20:51:34.302000+00:00
sifu0620	hey there i ran an operator node on goerli, any clear and precise allocation with the drop?	2024-05-05T20:29:38.284000+00:00
will2052	It’s pretty simple, if you weren’t in the top 200 of goerli your node didn’t contribute anything	2024-05-05T16:12:15.656000+00:00
0xwaveee	"Team should cut off all nodes that have 0 eth delegated to them and also consider nodes that have more than 2 months running, not just the people that hopped in on the holesky testnet.
I think that nodes that were set up on goerli and stayed for holesky should definitly get a little compensation. 

Try these criteria, 32 eth in the node
Amount of Eth delegated
Running time and you will 

Or send minimum allocation to everynode runner and then check criterias for bigger allocations"	2024-05-05T13:52:41.514000+00:00
lyde17tc	I don't agree that operators on holesky should receive an allowance as well!	2024-05-05T10:20:52.168000+00:00
astro0139	"I don't know what is the team decision about node runners but consider all of us please, some of them couldn't stay on the AVS for 2-3 months but they spent a few thousands dollars 2-3 or more for buying geth
This isn't a big challenge for team"	2024-05-05T09:29:12.816000+00:00
nirnaeth.	Its OK bud. Hope we all get good news soon	2024-05-05T08:50:51.072000+00:00
mojtaba93	No worries. The money stuck is the minimum, we are talking about the reward for our time and work and support of our node for several months, not just the money. Sorry for my language on that reply.	2024-05-05T08:48:05.109000+00:00
nirnaeth.	I spent it too, but not as much as you, and I take it all back through layer zero when the goerli network close day approches. The title says testnet participants, not those who are stuck with money, I didn't read the entire speech, it's too long, I think I can determine whether I still have the right to speak here or not based on this title and sorry for your situation too.	2024-05-05T08:43:16.155000+00:00
mojtaba93	Did you spend that money? If not what is the point of being here?	2024-05-05T08:39:00.095000+00:00
nirnaeth.	sorry I jump in the conversation very late.	2024-05-05T08:38:56.867000+00:00
fuzzyman410	Haha that is the main complaint in this chat, every other node project using goerli migrated months in advance	2024-05-05T08:37:42.072000+00:00
nirnaeth.	well imo there is no guilt about this on team, you should take care yourself on the first place. anyway lets wait the updates	2024-05-05T08:36:45.446000+00:00
fuzzyman410	Nobody did, but it was because of the team’s slow schedule that our funds were stuck there, they could and should have migrated earlier	2024-05-05T08:35:30.044000+00:00
mojtaba93	We put our try to help to debug the system for mainnet, on the other hand someone like justin sun just by depositing and withdrawing money got a big amount of tokens.	2024-05-05T08:35:24.675000+00:00
fuzzyman410	Yes sure i understand that, but there was no promise of rewards in the first place, we set up the nodes with a hope of getting rewards, but there was no guarantee, but the funds stuck in goerli should have been retrievable but they were lost due to the team’s negligence and slow schedule	2024-05-05T08:35:00.161000+00:00
nirnaeth.	what?! who told you to spend 10k on geth and run operator node lol this is not logical al all	2024-05-05T08:34:36.540000+00:00
mojtaba93	It is not just about the  those geth, what about the stress, time, and effort behind them?	2024-05-05T08:33:23.901000+00:00
nirnaeth.	yes but my signing rate was too low cuz it was very hard to stay on active set as you know. I hope team will find a middle way	2024-05-05T08:33:21.265000+00:00
fuzzyman410	I couldn’t care about “extra rewards” I just want the money I lost	2024-05-05T08:32:52.207000+00:00
fuzzyman410	Holesky also contributed far less, was live for 1 month vs goerli 6 months	2024-05-05T08:32:29.655000+00:00
fuzzyman410	This is not the point, majority of of people here do not care about rewards, we just want compensation for what was lost, approximately $10k of funds stuck in goerli testnet	2024-05-05T08:32:00.853000+00:00
hyuk	Holesky didnt even matter, mainnet was shortly after	2024-05-05T08:11:19.999000+00:00
luz33c	"Same here, I think both Goerli and holesky should be rewarded, but with a difference: holesky I think can be considered only top200, but Goerli should be all.
Because holesky has a short time and goerli has a long time, but both the eigenda of both test nets contributed to the final mainnet online. And eigenda was running the service for real, and should rightly be rewarded no matter which network."	2024-05-05T07:38:01.372000+00:00
effenberggesture	"1. I disagree. I think Holesky active set operators and those Goerli operators, who have been in the active set for some period of time, but were eliminated by bigger stakes, also deserve rewards.

2. What mechanic of distribution do you think would be fair? Linear distribution accordingly to the % of signing rate seems to me as the best approach.

Also, it would be great if the team clearly announce the allocation for testnet operators the same way they did it for Stakedrop with 15% in the initial announcement and 280M additional tokens in the latest update"	2024-05-05T04:47:02.238000+00:00

1.  block#10664008 Goerli

effenberggesture	"2 questions to you then:

1. Top-200 at what point of time?

2. What kind of distribution you think would be fair?"	2024-05-05T01:41:32.741000+00:00
.mormoon	Only 200	2024-05-05T00:56:30.986000+00:00
effenberggesture	"Not the current top-200, but only those, who have been in the active set for some period. With linear distribution accordingly to the % of signing rate.

This seems a very reasonable approach to me"	2024-05-04T23:32:08.539000+00:00
nirnaeth.	why only 200? big instuties got many eth and fill most of the spot	2024-05-04T19:44:11.356000+00:00
luz33c	I think either goerli or holesky should get airdrops as long as they are top 200 eigenda nodes, holesky contributes to the official environment as much as goerli.	2024-05-04T11:54:14.631000+00:00

gus33	"If we get a lousy 1200 $eigen for being in the top 200 for several months that's just disrespectful

That's .01% of supply lol, 15% of the tokens are set aside for research and development, grants, operational expenses, and overall ecosystem growth.

How much more can we contribute to the ecosystem growth and development of eigen then by running a testnet node?

.2% at the VERY least should be distributed to the top 200 testnet runners not .01% lol cmon."	2024-05-03T15:21:23.088000+00:00

effenberggesture	"Feel the same. It's ~1.66% of the supply for additional allocation to the stakes. As far as I understand, it's now ~16.77% in total and 6.77% of them for Season 1. Meanwhile my rough estimation of the initial allocation for operators is ~0.01%.

As far as only "missed allocations" are mentioned in the p3 of the announcement, such a difference in the evaluation of stakers and active operators contribution seems discouraging. I understand the testnet wasn't incentivized, but staking wasn't incentivized either. Wait for more details though"	2024-05-02T23:07:15.420000+00:00

levelsdennis	i do think it is probably worth noting that they intended and anticipated for it to be extremely competitive (read: expensive) to test properly, and my understanding was that was part of the reason to use goerli aside from ease of getting lots of tokens. perhaps i misunderstood but at least that was what i gathered.	2024-05-01T23:12:10.250000+00:00

sweetsensi	but mainnet started much more after 15th March	2024-05-01T19:57:06.692000+00:00
arturionx	"Ok, thanks for the answer

The problem was we had no official info from team and no clear instructions. Like do I have a deadline, DMs closed, Ticket closed, total mess.

Concerning the problem the main point is not rewards or anything, but an unprecedented loss per node. I do agree with AVS payments and time spend - it's a game all cryptomarket participants play and we do accept the rules.

But cmon lets be clear, such a huge expenses (loss of our stake in value that was 10k$ a week before goerli deprecation) was never expected by anyone. For a second it's an average salary in my country for 16 month.

Waiting for info."	2024-05-01T19:50:23.043000+00:00
.xkamx	but whatever, I've said my piece, and hopefully we see some progress or communication before the week is out. otherwise we'll just have to go make noise elsewhere and more loudly. hoping it doesn't come to that	2024-05-01T19:44:15.431000+00:00
.xkamx	not sure what there is to "investigate". they literally collected this same info to figure out who they should send hETH to (which was ridiculous at the time, and is even moreso now). they purposefully left goerli ops out of the allocation, which can be viewed any number of ways; none of which reflect positively on the team. now we wait, but I would think getting some sort of actual communication out should be a priority, as I don't think this is just going away as much as they'd probably like it to	2024-05-01T19:42:31.210000+00:00

.xkamx	I've now opened a ticket as well. I understand that this isn't your doing <@875066441714520064>, and none of this is your fault. I also appreciate your willingness to assist and the fact that you and your team have remained patient in dealing with this. But if I'm being honest, the number of hoops that we're being made to jump through here just feels like an added slap in the face. Information about who was in the active set, for how long, and how many batches they each signed should be easily trackable for the team using onchain data and other means...and if it's not, that's concerning in and of itself. I spent too much time last night writing up my thoughts on the situation, which your bot flagged and deleted immediately (still no answer as to why), so I won't make that mistake again. But I will say this: There seems to be a clear lack of regard for the people in this group, and it's difficult to understand why. As others have laid out, operators are the lifeblood of Eigen, so shunning them like this just seems counter to the projects interest (and common sense). And it's not like we're asking for much, we just want to be made whole, and maybe even made to feel like our time, efforts, and money weren't completely wasted. And ideally some sort of communication from the team feels necessary at this point.	2024-05-01T17:30:06.384000+00:00

soniya6790	Out of the vast pool of operators, a mere 453 nodes have risen to the esteemed ranks of the top 200 AVS.

romank6511	"There was only about 500 operators who was in top200 for some period. It super small amounts for such huge projects. Even small projects have no problems to reward such small amounts of validators/operators.
Ok I would accept if noone was rewarded, but I see that "Some users" was rewarded. I want to know the criteria, but team do not share this information. We have to DM moderators who not responding while as was sayed above all needed information are available. What next? Will they refer us to send fax or paper letter?"	2024-05-01T11:14:15.407000+00:00

avgust_by	"Everything is clear that this testnet was not incevized but we should not have lost 10k while participating.

I'm sure that the team is aware of this and by collecting wallets in DM it tries to avoid answering 1 question - how to openly and clearly solve the problem with loss of funds? I'll answer for them - properly reward participants from the top200, you have our operator addresses, nothing more needed for that."	2024-05-01T10:46:49.102000+00:00
arturionx	"Guys, I have only one point about the situatuon.
Yes, testnet was not incentivised and no tokens were promised.
But either there were no information about A TOTAL LOSS OF 10 000 $ due to Goerli suspension.

Why there were no pre-migration? Any announcement? NO! Just keep running nodes.

I would like to say that no actions were taken to prevent us from financial loss.

So far this is the worst testnet I have EVER participated. Even tier 3 projects encourage testnet users. And Eigen is a locomotive of restaking narrative (main narrative) of this bull market.

Without throwing away wallets first to one person, then to another (who in the end doesn't read them) and without specifics.
Just formulate whether you will review the moneyback for people who were in the top200
If not, then formulate why some node runners received one amount, others much less, others nothing at all.
In this way situation will be more clear for everyone.

web3cm	I know it's not hard to understand. I know you have been asking about that. I'm just clarifying the available info at the moment, as we wait for more clarity from the team. I'm still waiting for more clarity on it all.	2024-04-30T22:44:30.643000+00:00
armankmi	you send 10 tokens to delegators  its fine. but where is the reward for AVS operators which spend more than 8k or 10k or 12k or more for buy goerlieth for there node?	2024-04-30T22:42:23.356000+00:00
armankmi	where is the share of 200 AVS?	2024-04-30T22:39:51.823000+00:00
armankmi	delegators and them who run the operator is different	2024-04-30T22:39:19.095000+00:00
armankmi	its not hard to understand	2024-04-30T22:38:38.819000+00:00
armankmi	please explain to us who is the (some test net users) some? what is the filter? and i say again we dont ask about delegators. we ask for reward for who run the AVS operator.	2024-04-30T22:38:21.548000+00:00
web3cm	"We only know this at the moment:

> Goerli Testnet Restakers
> In recognition of the Goerli testnet shutdown and the associated inconvenience for testnet participants, a small EIGEN token allocation has been made to some testnet users. Future testnets, including Holesky, will not include token allocations. The primary goal of EigenLayer testnets is to facilitate testing and preparation for mainnet participation.

And for that we're getting some wallets to review. I'm talking to the team to gain more clarity on all this, so stay tuned as we go about the process."	2024-04-30T22:32:04.347000+00:00
armankmi	3000*200=600,000 tokens.... **its only  %0.035  of total supply. in other words. its nothing for the team ** and if they send us more we are more thankful.	2024-04-30T22:28:18.270000+00:00
armankmi	i think at least 3000 tokens is fair for  each one of 200 operators	2024-04-30T22:27:44.660000+00:00
armankmi	how much of tokens goes to us?	2024-04-30T22:26:10.967000+00:00

We are your partner who pay more than 10,000 dollars for support your project and help you for improve your function.
We lose our money only becuase your Early immigration to holesky. We supported your project with all our strength. And now it makes sense to get a good reward.

web3cm	Please stand by. I'm trying to get the process straight from the team to do so in a more orderly manner.	2024-04-30T22:03:40.335000+00:00
kmi99	They already have our address	2024-04-30T22:02:57.278000+00:00
nejn	Not only that, if the eigen team literally gave a fraction of a fraction of percent, the operators would be whole. But with the current allocation, they'd rather make the insiders, vcs, and team rich on the backs of rugged operators	2024-04-30T22:02:56.713000+00:00
kmi99	"It is ridiculous. We need go to admin dm one by one for send our address and then nothing.
We only need clear and offical announ for AVS reward."	2024-04-30T22:02:33.695000+00:00
coconutpalm	<@875066441714520064> don't make more errors, talk to the team about proper approach and do proper announcement.. you are only adding fuel to the fire with these DMs!	2024-04-30T22:00:14.306000+00:00

coconutpalm	How professional is this collecting of addresses in a support thread on Discord? That must be a joke and I've been defending EL everywhere till now.. You have all the data, those who don't DM you don't get tokens or what? Been in active set for months and lost $10k	2024-04-30T21:58:50.761000+00:00
vikanren	Could you give a sign about that you see our DMs? Nobody is sure about it here I think.	2024-04-30T21:58:07.622000+00:00
harambo16	1 $EIGEN/1gETH would be great	2024-04-30T21:58:03.722000+00:00
nejn	This seems kinda ignorant, did he have to spend 4.5k on an AWS ec2 instance? No of course not. But fact of the matter is that eigen requested the community to provide resources that aws considers to be worth  4.5k/x amount of months. In order for them to develop in a nearly identical environment as mainnet they use decentralization and the community to provide those resources. Of which the people who participated got riddled with maintenance, mandatory updates, and a rug of over $12k if you were in eigenda. This happens after the eigen team announces a 55% allocation of their 10 billion dollar project to team and vcs. All while the allocation of who did get an airdrop not transferrable. It's just a slap in the face, without the validators the eigen product does not exist.	2024-04-30T21:57:55.916000+00:00

.mormoon	"Allow me to clarify: Node operators and Holesky operators aren't part of this discussion as there are no incentives for them, as stated by the Team. 

However, incentives were mentioned for " AVS Operators on Goerli " in announcements and the whitepaper. Yet, many TOP200 users (as of the Goerli shutdown) reported receiving zero incentives, which is the main concern here. 

Fortunately, the Mod has started collecting valid addresses.

marchini1717	Even at that moment when the goerli network was laid down, it seemed to me that this was a strange testnet, and a very strange reaction from the team, they were silent until the fad was full, and after that you decided to give out some holesky. Now the situation resembles the same thing, only with real money. “we don’t know anything, figure it out for yourself, you are no longer such an important part of the community and decentralization”	2024-04-30T07:13:12.603000+00:00
marchini1717	we lost money, time and effort to get into the top 200 Goerly from November 23. as a result, you threw us a holesky - rejoice (but be sure to return it), and we will drop you a lot of coins that did not even cover your costs to be in the top 200. But when the goerli network fell and the team was obviously not ready for this, you wrote that you operators are the most important part of our ecosystem and without you there would be no decentralization. but in fact we have what we have. you didn't even cover the expenses, this is ridiculous	2024-04-30T07:06:55.450000+00:00

fuzzyman410	yep, just repay what was lost, they are taking 50% of supply for themselves, 0.2% of supply would cover it	2024-04-30T03:03:39.348000+00:00

fuzzyman410	The funny part about this all is that we all lost money because the team was too lazy and disorganised to migrate testnets earlier, we are all down 5 figs, and the team couldn't even compensate any of us for their own mistake	2024-04-30T02:35:01.252000+00:00
nejn	So let me get this straight, I supply a service for half a year, put in my personal money so i can stay in eigenda, get rugged for 5 figs. All doing so while the eigen team uses my node to develop their $10 billion dollar product, of which they get 55% of (with investors). Then when it comes to airdrop day it favors insiders over anyone who has consistently provided resources for the product. How can the team justify this level of greed? The operators of eigen are part of the reason the product exists in the first place.	2024-04-30T02:33:18.690000+00:00
bholu.eth	still time to rethink, don't mess it up.	2024-04-30T02:20:49.256000+00:00
bholu.eth	Disrespectful to say the least. I don't care about an "additional" airdrop. I literally just want to be made whole at this poiint - incredibly inconsiderate move given that it could've easily been avoided had holesky migration been done earlier or there was a heads up given before goerli shutdown. to think that people would've willingly shut down their operators because it's just supposed to be a testnet is just delusional, people put their own money in because the requirements were so crazy. tonedeaf to think that 100s of people would be doing this "just for fun" for months on end, spending real money, for them to just lose all of that at the end.	2024-04-30T02:20:33.441000+00:00

The intention was not to run a node with the expectation of receiving an airdrop but the fact that you airdropped to “SOME” testnet users is ridiculous. Not only did you airdrop to SOME users, you didn’t airdrop to ANY of us node runners. I spent time and money to help with YOUR Mainnet launch and what did I get in return? 0 EIGEN. 0. Please reevaluate your distribution, this makes absolutely  no sense. <@768866007821320232>	2024-04-30T00:39:20.835000+00:00
kafka4338	yeah this is not fair please consider airdrop for node operators if the documents say " Operators play a crucial role " wihtout operators eigenlayer was not possibel so operators should get allocation	2024-04-30T00:08:37.257000+00:00

avgust_by	EL team, before starting the project you should have figured out how to run tesnets and how to reward devs. We spent 20k for depricated goerli ETH and got nothing as a reward, you dont understand what you are doing....	2024-04-29T20:03:55.941000+00:00

romank6511	yes. If team did not want the community contributon it would be simple to make a private testnet. not the public. Many peoples because this testnet was not able to sell the gETH before the network was stopped.	2024-04-29T19:41:30.182000+00:00
bkz	specially when so many people that invested time and resources to be part of the testnet	2024-04-29T19:40:20.287000+00:00
bkz	would be nice to know what was the criteria...	2024-04-29T19:39:38.137000+00:00
bkz	some could be a raffle to 5% of the users	2024-04-29T19:39:20.177000+00:00
romank6511	"some testnet users" is not a clear explanation. Team should explain why some openators from top200 get drop but other did not. Team give me only hETH and in the form I was required to agree to return them back.	2024-04-29T19:37:49.774000+00:00

q.w.e.r.t.y	Of course, I've heard that an operator requires some amount ETH (Goerli), but for it to cost that much. It's really weird that there are no mentions from eigen team. <@768866007821320232> any thoughts?	2024-04-29T17:57:31.860000+00:00
